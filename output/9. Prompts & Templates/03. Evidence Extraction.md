<pre class="notion-ascii-diagram"><code><strong>Extract statistical evidence from the sentence. Report ONLY what the paper states, not your assessment.</strong>

SENTENCE: {raw_sentence}

IDENTIFY THESE FLAGS (true if present, false if not):

STATISTICAL CONTENT:
- has_pvalue: Is a p-value mentioned? (p=, p&lt;, p&gt;)
- has_effect_size: Is an effect size mentioned? (OR, HR, RR, beta)
- has_ci: Is a confidence interval mentioned?
- has_sample_size: Is a sample size mentioned? (n=, N=)
- has_correlation: Is a correlation mentioned? (r=, R²=)
- has_adjusted: Does it mention &quot;adjusted&quot; or &quot;multivariate&quot;?
- has_regression: Does it mention &quot;regression&quot;?

EXTRACT VALUES FROM THE PAPER (not generate):
- p_values: The actual p-values stated
- effect_sizes: The actual effect sizes stated
- sample_sizes: The actual sample sizes stated
- correlations: The actual correlations stated

EVIDENCE CHARACTERISTICS (from what the paper states):
- is_primary_outcome: Does the sentence say &quot;primary outcome&quot;?
- is_secondary_outcome: Does the sentence say &quot;secondary outcome&quot;?
- is_prespecified: Does the sentence say &quot;prespecified&quot;?
- has_power_calculation: Does the sentence mention &quot;power calculation&quot;?
- multiple_testing_corrected: Does it mention Bonferroni/FDR correction?
