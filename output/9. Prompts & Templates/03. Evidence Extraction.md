# Evidence Extraction


## Content


```plain text
Extract statistical evidence from the sentence. Report ONLY what the paper states, not your assessment.


SENTENCE: {raw_sentence}

IDENTIFY THESE FLAGS (true if present, false if not):

STATISTICAL CONTENT:
- has_pvalue: Is a p-value mentioned? (p=, p<, p>)
- has_effect_size: Is an effect size mentioned? (OR, HR, RR, beta)
- has_ci: Is a confidence interval mentioned?
- has_sample_size: Is a sample size mentioned? (n=, N=)
- has_correlation: Is a correlation mentioned? (r=, R²=)
- has_adjusted: Does it mention "adjusted" or "multivariate"?
- has_regression: Does it mention "regression"?

EXTRACT VALUES FROM THE PAPER (not generate):
- p_values: The actual p-values stated
- effect_sizes: The actual effect sizes stated
- sample_sizes: The actual sample sizes stated
- correlations: The actual correlations stated

EVIDENCE CHARACTERISTICS (from what the paper states):
- is_primary_outcome: Does the sentence say "primary outcome"?
- is_secondary_outcome: Does the sentence say "secondary outcome"?
- is_prespecified: Does the sentence say "prespecified"?
- has_power_calculation: Does the sentence mention "power calculation"?
- multiple_testing_corrected: Does it mention Bonferroni/FDR correction?

RULES:
- Extract ONLY values explicitly stated in the sentence
- Do NOT calculate or generate values
- Do NOT assess quality - only report what's stated
