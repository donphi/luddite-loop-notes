- interpretation: Interprets what results mean
- discussion: Discusses implications
- limitation: States a study limitation
- conclusion: States a conclusion

- background: Provides background information
- prior_work: References previous studies

IDENTIFY SPECIAL SIGNALS (true/false):
- mentions_not_studied: Says something was &quot;not studied&quot; or &quot;not examined&quot;
- is_negative_result: Reports no effect/no difference
- contradicts_previous: Says &quot;contrary to&quot; or &quot;unlike previous&quot;
- identifies_gap: Mentions a &quot;gap&quot; in knowledge

OUTPUT FORMAT:

    &quot;is_negative_result&quot;: false,
