## Prompts & Templates — Entry 2: Synonym Generation Prompt for UK Biobank Fields

**Via:** OpenRouter  
**Response Quality:** Excellent  
**Model Used:** Claude 3.7 Sonnet  
**Date:** 2025-08-13  
**Prompt Output:** # Phenotype Synonym Generation – CSV Augmentation

## Purpose
Enhance an existing CSV of phenotypes by adding five alternative terms for each, improving matching across datasets and literature where terminology varies.

## Process
- Batch Processing: generate_synonyms.py run locally or via Docker in batches of 10–30 entries.
- Output: Each phenotype gets five context-relevant synonyms appended as new CSV columns.
- Tracking: Script logs batch range, next start index, % complete, elapsed/remaining time, and completion time.

## Examples

### Neuroimaging
1936: Mean L2 in anterior limb of internal capsule on FA skeleton (right)Synonyms: FA right anterior limb; right ALIC FA; right internal capsule FA; fractional anisotropy right ALIC; right anterior limb skeleton3871: Volume of Pole-temporal (left hemisphere)Synonyms: left pole-temporal volume; left temporal pole volume; left TP volume; left anterior temporal lobe volume; left pole-temporal region measurement

---

### Congenital Condition Dates
5776: Date Q63 first reported (other congenital malformations of kidney)Synonyms: first kidney malformation date; congenital renal anomaly onset; Q63 diagnosis date; initial malformation detection; congenital kidney abnormality date5799: Date Q90 first reported (Down’s syndrome)Synonyms: Down syndrome diagnosis date; T21 detection date; trisomy 21 identification; fetal aneuploidy detection; chromosomal abnormality timing

---

### Device & Measurement Metadata
4829: Device IDSynonyms: device ID; device identifier; equipment ID; identification number; device identification4834: Max readings > +/-8g before calibration (5s epoch)Synonyms: acceleration extrema; peak gravitational force; g-force maxima; maximum acceleration values; peak g-force readings

---

## Notes
- Synonyms include clinical terms, abbreviations, anatomical names, and plain-language variants.
- Benefits:
- Data harmonization for multi-cohort studies
- Ontology mapping (MeSH/HPO)
- Improved search recall
- Processing speed: ~45–47 minutes per batch; full dataset (~5,803 phenotypes) completed in sequence.
  
**Prompt Text:** ## Prompt

You are a medical terminology expert helping to identify how scientific measurements and characteristics are described in peer-reviewed biomedical literature.

For each measurement or characteristic provided, generate EXACTLY 5 alternative ways this concept appears in scientific papers. Follow these strict rules:

1. Include the most common abbreviation if one exists (e.g., BMI for body mass index)
2. Include one formal medical term if different from the given term
3. Include one commonly used informal variant that appears in methods sections
4. Include one measurement-focused description if applicable
5. Include one British English variant if different from the given term (considering UK Biobank is British)

Format your response as a semicolon-separated list. Be concise - each alternative should be 1-4 words maximum.

IMPORTANT: Only include terms that would appear in peer-reviewed medical literature. Do not include:
- Colloquial or patient-facing language
- Overly broad terms that could match unrelated concepts
- Terms specific to other measurement systems or contexts
- Speculative or rarely-used variants

EXAMPLES TO GUIDE YOUR APPROACH:

Simple measurement:
Input: "Waist circumference"
Output: "WC;abdominal circumference;waist measurement;waist girth;abdominal girth"

Complex procedural description:
Input: "Time since interview start at which blood pressure screen(s) shown"
Output: "BP timing;blood pressure timepoint;BP measurement time;pressure reading interval;BP assessment timing"
Note: Extract the core concept - don't preserve the complex phrasing

Lateralized measurement:
Input: "Hand grip strength (left)"
Output: "left HGS;left grip force;left hand dynamometry;non-dominant grip;left handgrip"
Note: Include abbreviation (HGS), consider dominance terminology

Automated/Manual distinction:
Input: "Heel bone mineral density (BMD) T-score, automated"
Output: "heel BMD T-score;calcaneal T-score;heel DXA score;heel bone density;calcaneal BMD"
Note: Papers may not specify automated vs manual - focus on the measurement itself

Now process this term: [FIELD_TITLE] and save in an adjust column called [FIELD_TITLE_SYNONYM]  
**Purpose:** The text outlines a process for enhancing a CSV file of phenotypes by generating five alternative terms for each to improve data matching across various datasets and literature.
