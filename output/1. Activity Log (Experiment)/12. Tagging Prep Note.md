# Tagging Prep (Note)


## Content


### Objective


Lightweight note on preparing for section‑aware tagging after enhancing chunking. Keep tagging context‑aware by knowing each chunk’s section.







---


### Process (brief)

- Redid chunking using the enhanced pipeline to preserve section hierarchy and normalized section names
- Verified YAML frontmatter and basic QC so tagger can rely on section context





---


### Notes

- Tagging quality improves when sections are known up front
- Prioritize tagging on normalized sections to reduce noise from admin content





---


### Next Step


Run the full biomedical NER tagging pass with section normalization enabled, then move to reclassification and vector indexing.
