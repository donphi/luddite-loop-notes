# Abruptly Cancelled


## Content


Unfortunately this meeting never happened. Before we could start with my dissertation discussion, Dr Corpas was insistent to speak about unrelated matters to my project. Dr Corpas left very shortly after the start of the meeting. Which ended up in unfounded accusations. I reached out to the westminster administration to ask for adjustment in my course leadership. It's a shame, the program that Im enlisted in AI and Digtital health started with 2 full time students and 1 part time. I ended up the only person left, and now the course leader and founder of the program does not have any oversight of the work and process of my dissertation. lasted 5 minutes







I do feel I can learn form an open discussion were peers are equal in respec, however I dont do well in a unfriend domineering circumstances which I found myself in many times with him. Sometimes open and complete friendly sometimes, then completely opposite, never inbetween
