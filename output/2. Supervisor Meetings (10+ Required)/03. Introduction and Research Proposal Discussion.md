## Supervisor Meetings (10+ Required) — Meeting 3: Introduction and Research Proposal Discussion

**Topics:** Planning  
**Supervisor:** Both Supervisors  
**Next Steps:** 1. Finalise research proposal draft by 24 April.
2. Prepare clear, non-technical explanation of project for cross-disciplinary discussions.
3. Schedule follow-up technical meeting with Dr Oliver to:
- Review AI methodology requirements.
- Identify potential challenges early.
4. Keep both supervisors informed of progress and role-specific needs.  
**Summary:**  
The meeting on April 1, 2025, discussed the progress of a research proposal due on April 24. It clarified the roles of supervisors, with Dr. Corpas providing process guidance and Dr. Oliver focusing on Big Data and AI. The need for additional expertise was identified, leading to Dr. Oliver's involvement. Action points include finalizing the proposal, preparing a non-technical project explanation, and scheduling a follow-up meeting with Dr. Oliver to address AI methodology.
