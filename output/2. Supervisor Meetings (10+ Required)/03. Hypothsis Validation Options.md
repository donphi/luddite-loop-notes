# Hypothsis Validation Options


## Content


## Summary

- Discussion centred on refining project idea to **overlapping features** approach.
- Concern raised about scope and workload – risk of overcommitment.
- **Dr Oliver** advised further narrowing of focus and avoiding need for large-scale data proofs.
- My position: maintain **practical application** and real testing, not purely theoretical work.
- Pushback acknowledged, but practical outputs remain my priority for industry relevance.
- **Dr Corpas** emphasised freedom to focus on chosen direction, even if it means pushing further.

## Key Discussion Points

- Overlapping features identified as main focus area.
- Time/resource constraints flagged – risk of exceeding manageable workload.
- Practical over theoretical: aim to build something **tangible** with immediate value.
- Masters project as portfolio work for future job opportunities.
- Dr Oliver provided most of the technical refinement guidance.
- Agreement that final decision on depth of scope lies with me.

## Action Points

1. Define **overlapping features** methodology in detail.
2. Develop a realistic **time-bound execution plan** to avoid project overruns.
3. Identify minimum viable dataset for proof-of-concept testing.
4. Ensure scope supports **both academic requirements and industry relevance**.

## Next Steps

- Draft a condensed execution plan balancing **practical delivery** with available time/resources.
- Begin outlining computational workflow for overlapping feature analysis.
