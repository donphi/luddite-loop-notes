## Supervisor Meetings (10+ Required) — Meeting 5: RAG Discussion

**Topics:** Hypothesis  
**Supervisor:** Both Supervisors  
**Next Steps:** 1. Clarify expectations for tool usage vs. principle-based approach.
2. Independently research methodological alignment between data science and life sciences.  
**Summary:**  
The RAG discussion on June 16, 2025, led by Dr. Oliver, highlighted a lack of input from Dr. Corpas and focused on foundational principles rather than tools. There was an identified gap between the data science and life sciences approaches, with no guidance provided to bridge this gap. Action points include clarifying expectations for tool usage and researching methodological alignment between disciplines, with follow-up questions planned for the next meeting.
