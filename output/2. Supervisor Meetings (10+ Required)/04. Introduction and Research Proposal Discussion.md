# Introduction and Research Proposal Discussion


## Content


## Summary

- Meeting held to discuss progress and direction of research proposal (due 24 April).
- Early meeting arranged to align expectations and define supervisory roles.
- Identified need for additional expertise in **Big Data** and **data science**.
- Current primary supervisor (**Dr Corpas**) suitable for process guidance, but limited in AI-heavy experimental/code aspects.
- Requested Westminster to assign a Big Data lecturer – **Dr Tom Oliver** now involved.
- This session focused on introductions and clarifying each lecturer’s role.
- Explaining project in simpler terms helped refine thinking around hypothesis formation.

## Key Discussion Points

- Clarified role of each supervisor:
    - **Dr Corpas**: Process and procedural guidance.
    - **Dr Oliver**: Big Data and AI technical guidance.
- Dr Oliver asked detailed, technical questions about proposal.
- Discussion reinforced importance of simplifying explanations for clarity.
- Early-stage conversations helped surface areas requiring deeper methodology planning.

---


## Action Points

1. Finalise research proposal draft by **24 April**.
2. Prepare clear, non-technical explanation of project for cross-disciplinary discussions.
3. Schedule follow-up technical meeting with Dr Oliver to:
    - Review AI methodology requirements.
    - Identify potential challenges early.
4. Keep both supervisors informed of progress and role-specific needs.

## Next Steps

- Complete proposal refinements based on clarity exercise.
- Develop structured plan for hypothesis testing phase.
