## Activity Log (80+ Required) — Entry 10: Marker Header Validation

**Hours:** 1  
**Date:** 2025-08-17  
**Next Steps:** The next step is to break the Markdown files into structured chunks while preserving document hierarchy and preparing the data for tagging.  
**Category:** 🧹 Data Preprocessing  
**Summary:**  
The document outlines a validation process for YAML frontmatter in Markdown files generated from UK Biobank PDF conversions, ensuring all required metadata is present to prevent errors during data handling. It describes the technical implementation using Python in a Docker environment and emphasizes the importance of this quality control step before further data processing.  

**Nr:** 10  
**Entry:** Marker Header Validation  

## Content


```markdown
## Objective
Validate YAML frontmatter in all Markdown files from the UK Biobank PDF conversion. Ensures every file has required metadata before chunking and tagging. Acts as a QC checkpoint to prevent downstream failures.

---

## Process
1. **Containerized Check**
   - Python 3.11 in Docker, orchestrated with docker-compose.  
   - Markdown directory mounted read-only.  

2. **Validation Logic**
   - Detect YAML frontmatter (`---`…`---` within 30 lines).  
   - Confirm required fields (`original_file`).  
   - Categorize errors and produce stats.  

3. **Output**
   - JSON reports with timestamp.  
   - Console summary with % valid vs invalid.  
   - Detailed error samples logged.  

---

## Validation
Reports include:  
- Total files processed.  
- Valid vs invalid counts.  
- Validation percentage.  
- Error breakdown with sample files.  

---

## Reflection
- Lightweight QC but critical before heavy chunking/tagging.  
- Containerization ensures reproducibility.  
- Most failures traced to missing or malformed frontmatter.  
- Script is fast, minimal, and dependency-free.  

---

## Next Step
Proceed to `data_conversion/ukb/4_tagging/1_chunk/`:  
- Break Markdown into structured chunks.  
- Preserve document hierarchy.  
- Prepare data for tagging.  

---

## Technical Implementation
- **Libraries**: Python stdlib only (`os`, `pathlib`, `json`, `datetime`).  
- **Dockerfile**: lightweight Python 3.11-slim with read-only volume mount.
