## Content


Objective



To obtain the remaining publications using approved metadata services and reference management tools, ensuring reproducibility and compliance with access rules.



Process


- Created a script to collect unresolved **DOI numbers** into a single `.txt` file.
- Converted the `.txt` file into a **.bib** format.
- Queried **Unpaywall** to retrieve metadata for each DOI and generated a complete `.bib` file.
- Installed **Zotero**, imported the `.bib` file, and configured the Zotero Connector to access institutional and open access platforms.
- Successfully retrieved **3,199 additional PDFs**, which combined with the initial **3,213 PDFs** totals **6,412 publications**.
- Identified the need to perform **deduplication** to ensure accuracy of the dataset.

Reflection



This workflow allowed for a more systematic and compliant acquisition of full-text publications. While Unpaywall and Zotero significantly improved coverage, gaps remain as some DOIs still failed to resolve. Careful deduplication will be essential to maintain data quality and prevent bias in subsequent analyses.



Next Step



Perform automated and manual deduplication of retrieved PDFs and confirm final counts before progressing to feature extraction.
