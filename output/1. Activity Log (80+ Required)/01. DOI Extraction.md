**Category:** 📘 Data Collection  
**Summary:**  
The objective was to obtain UK Biobank publications for analysis, resulting in the identification of 8,528 publications, with 2,905 PDF links successfully resolved. The next step is to automate DOI resolution for the remaining 5,623 records to complete the publication set.

## Content


Objective:



To obtain the complete set of UK Biobank publications for downstream analysis of feature selection and methodological trends.



Process:


1. Downloaded the **Schema files** from the UK Biobank Showcase portal.
2. Retrieved **Schema 19 (Publications)** directly via the repository:[https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/download.cgi](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/download.cgi)
3. Developed a Python script to systematically **extract DOI identifiers** and **PDF links** for each publication.
    - Total publications identified: **8,528**.
    - Successfully resolved PDF links: **2,905**.
    - Remaining **5,623 records required DOI-based resolution** due to missing or inactive schema links.

Reflection:



This step confirmed that the schema resource is incomplete as a single point of access. A total of ~66% of publication links could not be directly retrieved, underlining the need for a two-stage retrieval process (schema + DOI resolution). 



Next Step:



Automate DOI resolution for the remaining 5,623 publications and validate against CrossRef to establish a complete publication set.
