**Next Steps:** The next step involves constructing a dataset using only institutionally accessible and open access journal papers with approved retrieval methods.  
**Category:** 📘 Data Collection  
**Summary:**  
The objective was to acquire UK Biobank publication PDFs, but attempts using automation tools failed due to access restrictions. The decision was made to rely solely on publications available through institutional subscriptions or open access to ensure compliance with research integrity.

## Content


Objective



To acquire the remaining UK Biobank publication PDFs not available directly via schema links, ensuring a near-complete dataset for review.



Process


- Attempted automated retrieval using **Playwright** in Python; this approach failed.
- Transitioned to the **Selenium** library with simpler button-finding methods.
- Configured a **WireGuard server** to protect IP identity during automated retrieval.
- Successfully downloaded ~485 PDFs before access was interrupted, suggesting restrictions by the source platform.

Reflection



Following discussion with my course leaders, we agreed this retrieval method was unsuitable and should not be included in the project. Instead, the decision was taken to rely only on publications accessible through Westminster University subscriptions or available as open access. This ensures compliance with research integrity and avoids any methodological risks associated with non-approved retrieval strategies:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.



Next Step



Proceed with dataset construction using only institutionally accessible and open access journal papers, employing whichever approved retrieval method is most reliable.
