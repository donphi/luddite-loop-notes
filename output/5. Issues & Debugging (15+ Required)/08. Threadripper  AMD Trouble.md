# Threadripper AI Workstation Stability Issue


## Background

- New build, not yet fully hardware-stabilised.
- No proper testing done for RAM overclocking or other tuning.
- Observed stalling over past few days — no immediate action taken until today.
- Today: **2 stalls** during runs → risk for long-running code execution.
- Code is crash-tolerant, but stability is critical for efficiency.

## Mitigation Steps

- Declocked **256GB RAM** from 6400 MHz → 6000 MHz.
    - 6400 MHz = auto setting (overclocked from 4800 MHz base).
    - Goal: test if 6000 MHz improves stability.
- Historical hardware experience helped to quickly identify risk.
- Other AMD system had complex boot issues → required external help (ChatGPT 5) to resolve.
- Both systems currently operational.
