# Threadripper RAM Trouble (Continued)

# Further Threadripper Freezing Issue


## Background

- Continued freezing despite lowering RAM frequency to 6000 MHz.
- Required further investigation → research via Reddit.

---


## Root Cause

- Threadripper systems with **8-channel RAM** are more sensitive to module stability.
- High overclock settings reduce long-term stability under continuous compute load.

---


## Resolution

- Recommended operational setting: **4800 MHz** (JEDEC standard).
- Lower frequency improves robustness for extended HPC workloads.
- Stability prioritised over minor performance gains.
