## Issues & Debugging (15+ Required) — Issue 8: Threadripper RAM Trouble (Continued)

**Description:**  
# Further Threadripper Freezing Issue

## Background
- Continued freezing despite lowering RAM frequency to 6000 MHz.
- Required further investigation → research via Reddit.

---

## Root Cause
- Threadripper systems with 8-channel RAM are more sensitive to module stability.
- High overclock settings reduce long-term stability under continuous compute load.

---

## Resolution
- Recommended operational setting: 4800 MHz (JEDEC standard).
- Lower frequency improves robustness for extended HPC workloads.
- Stability prioritised over minor performance gains.
  

**summary:** The Threadripper system experienced freezing issues even after reducing RAM frequency to 6000 MHz, attributed to the sensitivity of 8-channel RAM modules. The solution is to set the RAM to an operational frequency of 4800 MHz, which enhances stability for high-performance computing workloads.
