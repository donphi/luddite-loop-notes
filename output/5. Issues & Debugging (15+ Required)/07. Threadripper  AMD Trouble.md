## Issues & Debugging (15+ Required) — Issue 7: Threadripper & AMD Trouble

**Description:**  
# Threadripper AI Workstation Stability Issue

## Background
- New build, not yet fully hardware-stabilised.
- No proper testing done for RAM overclocking or other tuning.
- Observed stalling over past few days — no immediate action taken until today.
- Today: 2 stalls during runs → risk for long-running code execution.
- Code is crash-tolerant, but stability is critical for efficiency.

---

## Mitigation Steps
- Declocked 256GB RAM from 6400 MHz → 6000 MHz.
- 6400 MHz = auto setting (overclocked from 4800 MHz base).
- Goal: test if 6000 MHz improves stability.
- Historical hardware experience helped to quickly identify risk.
- Other AMD system had complex boot issues → required external help (ChatGPT 5) to resolve.
- Both systems currently operational.  

**summary:** The Threadripper AI workstation is experiencing stability issues due to RAM overclocking, resulting in stalls during runs that jeopardize long-running code execution. To mitigate this, the 256GB RAM was declocked from 6400 MHz to 6000 MHz to test for improved stability.
