## PDF Processing Error Documentation

### Technical Details
**File**: `2021_Sun_10.10 1.pdf` (4.5 MB)  
**Error**: `IndexError: list index out of range` at line 271 in `marker/processors/table.py`  
**Function**: `combine_dollar_column()` - attempts to merge currency columns in tables  
**Cause**: Table contained empty column array where data was expected

### Plain English
The PDF converter crashed when trying to read a table in this document. The software expected to find cells in a table column but found nothing there - like looking for item [0] in an empty list. This happens when academic papers have complex tables with merged cells or irregular layouts that don't match the standard grid format the converter expects.

### Impact
- 1 file lost out of 6,646 (0.015% data loss)
- Known limitation in Marker v0.2.x with non-standard table formatting
- File metadata preserved, only full-text extraction failed
